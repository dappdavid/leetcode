Given an array arr of distinct elements and a list of subsequences seqs of the array, the task is to check whether the given array can be uniquely constructed from the given set of subsequences.
Examples: 
 

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}, seqs[][] = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}} 
Output: Yes 
Explanations: The sequences [1, 2], [2, 3], and [3, 4] can uniquely reconstruct 
the original array {1, 2, 3, 4}. 
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}, seqs[][] = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}} 
Output: No 
Explanations : The sequences [1, 2], [2, 3], and [2, 4] cannot uniquely reconstruct 
{1, 2, 3, 4}. There are two possible sequences that can be constructed from the given sequences: 
1) {1, 2, 3, 4} 
2) {1, 2, 4, 3}
