 Given a singly linked list L0 -> L1 -> … -> Ln-1 -> Ln. Rearrange the nodes in the list so that the new formed list is : L0 -> Ln -> L1 -> Ln-1 -> L2 -> Ln-2 … You are required to do this in place without altering the nodes’ values. 

Examples: 

Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
Output: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
 
 Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
